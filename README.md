## Fishing
Fishing is the core mechanic that the game revolves around, each player has a starting rod that they use to collect fish.
While fishing a minigame pops up for the player to play, if they are successful a fish is added to their inventory. These
fish then can be sold at shops.

## Inventory Management
The player will start off with a small amount of inventory slots having to frequently travel from fishing location to shop
back to fishing location. This will be remedied with mid and late game upgrades allowing for more inventory capacity and 
different types of inventories

## Bopping
You can mess with other players in the lobby by "bopping" them. This briefly stuns the player and allows you to:
- Steal their fish
- Stop their current action

## Economy
The economy is dynamic swaying with supply and demand. Fish that are sold frequently dip in price and fish that are rarly
sold have increased prices.

## Upgrades
Different item upgrades will be available for purchese, this allows for cost benefit analysis.

Upgrade examples:
- Different level fishing rods
- Boats for traversing different water types
- Climbing gear for reaching high waters
- Lanterns for traversing dark caves
- Backpacks for upgrading your bodies inventory capacity
- Wagons for exterior inventory capacity

# Goal
The goal is to have as much currency as possible in your inventory at the end of the game.
